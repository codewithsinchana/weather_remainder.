**Weather Reminder in Python**
Hi , I Have written a simple Python code that fetches real-time weather data for the city by user input using **OpenWeatherMapAPI** and it also remainds about rain conditions based on location.
**Features**
Fetches real-time weather data based on city name.
Automatically reminds you if rain is expected.
Uses a free weather API (OpenWeatherMap).
Fully written in Python, no hardware require.
**Technologies Used**
Python 3.
`requests` library.
OpenWeatherMap API.
**How to run**
1. **Clone the repository**(VS Code)  
   git clone https://github.com/codewithsinchana/weather_remainder.git
   cd weather_remainder.
   Install required libraries
2. **pip install requests**
Replace the API key.
Open the file weather_remainder.py.
Replace:
api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY".
with your actual key from OpenWeatherMap.
3.**Run the script**
python weather_remainder.py
**OUTPUT**
Weather in Bangalore
Temperature: 27.3Â°C
Condition: Overcast Clouds
Humidity: 64%
Reminder:
Carry an umbrella, it might rain today!
Finally push to github ,the python code.
